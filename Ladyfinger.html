            <p><b>
                A Ladyfinger Peak is a rock spire among the nearby peaks, although it has little prominence above the saddle with nearby Hunza Peak. It provides a 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) rock climb (with a very serious alpine approach) and has been the scene of some notable paragliding.

                Bublimotin is a sharp, relatively snowless, rock spire among the nearby peaks, although it has little prominence above the saddle with nearby Hunza Peak. It provides a 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) rock climb (with a very serious alpine approach) and has been the scene of some notable paragliding.

                An interesting folk tale about the peak (Bubli mo Ting literally means 'Bubli's peak) is that Kisar, a (magical) prince from Baltistan, came to Hunza on one of his adventures and married a princess, a gas, called Bubli. When he received news that his first wife in Baltistan, Langabrumo, had been kidnapped (by a phut or a deu, one story says, but according to Lorimer's book it is a king from another country), he immediately made preparations to set off and rescue her. He took Bubli up to this mountain, (later named after her), and handed her a sack of grain as well as a hen or chicken (a qarqamuts). She must have asked whether - and when - he would be back and he told her: "Every year give this chicken a single grain to eat. When the sack is empty, I will return. Until that time, stay here." He left, and, they say, Bubli is waiting there still.
