        </b></h1>
<p><b>
    Lulusar is group of mountains near the Naran Valley in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. It is famous for the large lake situated there which is a popular tourist attraction. The word “sar” means “top” or “peak” in Pashto.

<p><b>
    The lake is the main source of the Kunhar river, which flows through the entire Kaghan Valley through Jalkhand, Naran Valley, Kaghan, Jared, Paras and Balakot until it joins the Jhelum River. The lake is 48 kilometers away from Naran, on the Naran-Babusar road. Lulusar marks the historic place where 55 participants of the 1857 war of independence were arrested.

    The lake is much bigger than other lakes around the valley, and is surrounded by snowcapped hills, making it a natural tourist attraction. From Gittidas, the Naran-Babusar road, one of the highest in the world, goes through the Babusar Pass to Gilgit. In the summer, when the water reflects its surroundings like a mirror, a large number of both domestic and international visitors make the lake a destination stop.A jeep can be hired from the Naran Valley to visit the lake. From Naran town, Lulusar can be reached in approximately 3 hours. Jeeps can be hired from Naran which will take you to Basel from where one can visit the Lulusar in approximately 30 minutes. There is a road being built around the lake which will link the Naran/Basel to Chilas. The same road also leads to Babusar Pass.
