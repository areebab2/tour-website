        <h1><b>About Kalam</b></h1>

        <p><b>
            Kalam is a valley located 99 kilometres (62 mi) from Mingora in the northern upper section of Swat valley along the banks of the Swat River in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The Swat River was formed as a result of the confluence of two major tributaries, the Gabral and Ushu river.At an elevation of about 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level, the valley itself provides room for a plateau that is located above the river and used for farming. There are mountains that are also visible from Matiltan, a valley close to Kalam Valley, including Mount Falaksar 5,918 meters (19,416 feet), and another unnamed peak 6,096 meters (20,000 feet) high.

            Kalam has large number of alpine glacial lakes. Two notable lakes in the Kalam Valley are the Mahodand lake and Kundol lake, both of which are frequently visited due to their easy access routes. Other lakes in the region, such as Izmis lake, are harder to enter and need to be done so on foot. Mahodand Lake is a large lake in the Swat Valley, located approximately 40 km from Kalam, in the Usho Sub-valley at the base of the Hindu Kush mountains. Another notable lake in the Kalam Valley is the Kundol Lake located in the north of Utror region, 19 km away from Kalam. It is located at the base of the Hindu Kush mountains.
