            One thing that i discourage about that place is that our elders tells us that if we go 20 30 years back,this place was in its true natural form and it was wonderfull. It is a common perception that any place which human has not discovered yet is still in its natural form. People donot care and do the littering allover the place. Junks of garbages could be found at the corners of the market place. Dust due to traffic has caused pollution. At saif ulmalook people throw rappers and leftovers in the lake. There must be some body to take responsibility and these actions must be taken care of.
