    In recent times the tourism industry of Pakistan has been in severe crisis, the major reason being terrorism in the country. Pakistan has been a victim of terrorism since Independence but after 9/11 when Pakistan agreed to join U.S in the war on terror, the incidence of terrorism in the country increased substantially. Tourists do not feel safe coming to Pakistan anymore. There have been incidents when tourists were targeted by the terrorists. Many of them were kidnapped for ransom while others were just killed for being Americans.

<p><b> 
    The reason for Pakistan being a tourist country is because of the multiple attractions in the country. The diverse culture, traditions, historical places, beautiful valleys are all factors behind Pakistan being an attractive tourist spot. There are historical places such as Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Taxila, which attract archeologists from all over the globe to come and visit the wonderful historic civilizations which are a part of Pakistan. Other than that the valleys of Pakistan have been able to attract tourists for a long period of time. There are valleys such as Swat, Hunza , Naran, Kaghan and beautiful hills like Murree, Nathia Gali, Changa Gali etc.

    The major cities of Pakistan are not behind when it comes to attracting foreign tourists. All of them have different aspects which define Pakistani Culture and traditions. Lahore is Pakistan’s second largest city and it is home to a large number of cultural places which has given it the title of being the cultural heart of the country. Lahore is remembered by historians for being the city where Alexander battled on River Jhelum. It is also remembered for having monuments of various Mughal emperors and Mughal architecture such as the Badshahi mosque, the tomb of Jahangir, Lahore Fort, Shalimar gardens and there is a long list In Which Some Of The Famous And Tourist Places We Will Discuss Down.

    Tourists, from within the country and abroad, like to visit the northern areas most of all. Their scenic beauty and charm are comparable to the best in the world, say, in Switzerland. The Hunza valley in the north is close to the famous K-2 and Rakaposhi mountains, among the highest peaks. Tourists stay in motels (hotels for travelers) and go on long walks, also attempting mountain climbing. The historical sites and cultural centers like tombs of famous saints and museums also attract a great number. We find Harappa, Moenjo-daro and Taxila, with their museums, are crowded most of the visiting time. Tourists also like to listen to the “qawalli” at shrines and tombs

    Tourism in the country is managed by the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation. It has its offices in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Abbottabad. It publishes tourism books, pamphlets, and pictures of tourist sites. It offers useful advice and guidance to tourists in different languages. It also provides guides to visiting tourists who take them around tourist spots and explain their features.
