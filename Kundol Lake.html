            Kundol Lake lies in the lap of Hindu kush mountains at an elevation of (9,950 ft), in the north of Utror, encompassed by snow clad mountains and towering trees. Similarly, the trail to the lake from Ladu is easy to follow as a large stream flows down from the lake, which merges with River Swat in Kalam valley. It leads beside the stream and takes you to the lake. On the way, lush green forests, picturesque spots and gushing waterfalls welcome one's to the region. The mountains around the lake are covered by thick blanket of vegetation that enhances the beauty of the lake very much. The margins of Kundol lake serve as the camping site during the summer season for the trekkers.[3]

            Kundol Lake is accessible only during the summer; during the winter, the roads are closed due to heavy snowfall. It can be accessed by an unpaved road from Kalam up to Utror in a four-wheel automotive where a link road ends in a green valley called Ladu in the foothills of the mountain. From Ladu it takes almost four to six hours to reach the lake. The mountains around this small valley are covered with tall cedar and pine trees
