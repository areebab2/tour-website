                Facts About Sapat Beach

                A major part of which is in Balochistan. Most of our beaches remain isolated and unexplored. Perhaps that is a good thing, as it has given the local wildlife freedom to live naturally. It would have been possible on the beaches in Karachi, had there been no human interference.

                Travel photographer Sohaib Roomi had been planning to head to this little strip — a desolate part of beach — at the end of Sapat Bandar Beach on the Makran coast for some time now. Some of the locals he had met at the Hingol National Park in his travels had told him about it. It’s a little hard to get there as the road becomes exceptionally bad. With mobile signals ending shortly after the Makran Coastal Highway begins, the only way to know its exact location is through its GPS coordinates. That is probably how it ended up getting tagged on Google Maps, but the maps won’t be able to show you a clear route to the spot. “We can use Sygic [an offline maps app] but there’s still no proper route marked,” says Roomi.

                The closest landmark is that it’s an hour away from Chandragup — the mud volcano revered and held sacred by the local Hindu community and which is a popular spot for local tourists and the astronomy club.

                “It’s all off-road and you need to make your own way,” says Roomi. “But there is a rough track next to the mud volcanos that also leads up to Sapat.” Sapat is a ‘long’ sandy beach in the vicinity. “We drove over plains, that’s all you see for around five to seven kilometres. We just made sure we were headed south and eventually, we ended up on the beach. This is the strategy you can use in case you’re headed there at night.” The terrain can get ‘wet’ warns Roomi, as you’re sometimes driving over dry river beds. “There’s no way possible to go there during the rainy season,” says the photographer. “You will need another route because this one will be flooded.”
