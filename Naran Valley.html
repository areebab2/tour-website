It is one of the most beautiful part of northern areas in pakistan which is elevated 2500 meters above sea level.

                The Inhabitant of Naran Valley are basically Gujars and I found them very generous and good natured. They welcome the tourists very nicely and treats them like their own friends.Their main source of income is the tourists and their occupations include tour guides, resthouse managers, shop keepers, restaurant workers, jeep drivers,  some of them also grow crops and some of them are shepherds. But their whole fortune is just gathered up in the summer season as in winters the whole area is covered up in snow and they have to move down to mansehra or some other hoter place. For that reason the prices over there are bit higher. For example the price of 100 rupee mobile card is about 107 up there. But i think that is fair enough as they this source of income just for limited time.

Some peple just sit by the river and put their feet under the cool water. You will feel dark in Naran valley in afternoon because these high mountains will stops sun light to reach in the valley.
